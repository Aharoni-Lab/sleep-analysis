# sleep-analysis
Learning to program by analyzing some sleep data!


# Starting a package!

To make a new package, we first handle some preliminary structing things
- Package structure (using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/))
- Docs (using [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/))
- Tests (maybe next time!)
- Notebooks (just putting them in a specific place and showing how to import from the package)
