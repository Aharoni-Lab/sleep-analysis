Learning to program by analyzing some sleep data!


# Starting a package!

To make a new package, we first handle some preliminary structing things
- Package structure (using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/))
  - Also see [PyOpenSci Packaging Guide](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/)
  - And the python docs - https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/
  - Learned about the pyproject.toml file and poetry.lock file (see poetry docs)
- Docs (using [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/))
  - read the docs tutorial https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/
  - Add repository to automatically build on commit - https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations.html
  - Configuration https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html
  - Furo theme! https://pypi.org/project/furo/
  - Poetry groups and readthedocs: https://browniebroke.com/blog/specify-docs-dependency-groups-with-poetry-and-read-the-docs/
- Tests (maybe next time!)
- Notebooks (just putting them in a specific place and showing how to import from the package)
